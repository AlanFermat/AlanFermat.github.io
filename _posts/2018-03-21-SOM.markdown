## What is unsupervised learning?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning">Unsupervised machine learning</a> is the machine learning task of inferring a function that describes the structure of "unlabeled" data. The goal for unsupervised learning is to detect some pattern behind a mass of data without any priori knowledge about the data. Sounds like roman policier? That's right!

Since the beginning of this field, a lot of unsupervised learning algorithms has been developed and applied widely.
