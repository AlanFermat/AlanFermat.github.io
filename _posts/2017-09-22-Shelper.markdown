## Shelper

This is an API built by 4 members during Rice Hackathon. 

This API connects emergency shelters with people who are looking for help during Hurricane Harvey. 

I implemented customized Google Map API (JSON and react.js) and visualized the live data on the screen from database (MongoDB). We deployed this API as a web app via Flask.
