description: Share what I've learned during my internship @Facebook Summer 2019

---

During my internship at Facebook in summer 2019, I learned a lot about engineering in real-world settings. I was assigned to Crisis Response team. The core product the team works on is Crisis Response Page. When natural disasters occur(for example, an earthquake), the users can use the page to know if their friends are marked themselves safe and if other people in the affected area are requesting or offering help. 
 My main projects are on the FBLite interface. FBLite is an interface that generally targets on the lower-end devices with less battery and processing power. A large portion of the users of FBLite is from developing countries. I built two main projects on FBLite for the team during the summer. 
My first project is to update the top of the page (“Crisis header”) with a new design. The new design looks like below.
