## Twitter Lower and Higher 
This is a web game developed in 24 hours during Rice Hackathon that will allow users to guess which person has a higher Twitter followers. 

In each round, you will be given two celebrities or famous organizations. You need to guess which one of the two has a higher followers on twitter.

If your answer is correct, you can go to the next round; otherwise, the game is over and you will receive your scores.

Try to reach a higher score!
